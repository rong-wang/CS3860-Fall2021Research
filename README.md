The MIDOG challenge is a challenge to detect mitotic figures in medical images so that detection is robust no matter what scanner is used. This is the challenge of domain generalization in microscopy images. <br>
This is my attempt to adapt MIDOG team's baseline domain adversarial model to a Google Colab. <br>
Currently, this code does not successfully distinguish 'hard negatives' and 'mitotic figures' due to bugs within the code. <br>
Much of the code is from the MIDOG team's baseline domain adversarial model, which can be found at https://github.com/DeepPathology/MIDOG. 
Other parts of the code are referenced from the MIDOG team's MIDOG_ObjectDetecton_101.ipynb. <br>
